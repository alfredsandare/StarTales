To blend the edges of an image with the surrounding pixels, you can use a technique called alpha blending or alpha compositing. This technique uses the alpha channel of the image to determine how it should be blended with the background.

Unfortunately, Pygame doesn't support this out of the box. You'll need to manually create a "fade-out" effect on the edges of your image. This can be done by creating a mask with a gradient alpha channel and applying it to your image.

Here's a simple example of how you can create such a mask:

import pygame
import numpy as np

def create_alpha_gradient(surface):
    # Create a new array with the same shape as the surface's alpha channel
    alpha = np.zeros(surface.get_size(), np.uint8)

    # Create a gradient in the x and y directions
    gradient = np.repeat(np.linspace(0, 255, surface.get_width()), surface.get_height()).reshape(surface.get_size())

    # Apply the gradient to the alpha channel
    alpha[:, :] = gradient

    # Create a new surface with the alpha channel
    mask = pygame.Surface(surface.get_size(), pygame.SRCALPHA)
    mask.fill((255, 255, 255, 0))
    pygame.surfarray.pixels_alpha(mask)[:] = alpha

    return mask

# Load your image
image = pygame.image.load('image.png').convert_alpha()

# Create the mask
mask = create_alpha_gradient(image)

# Apply the mask to the image
image.blit(mask, (0, 0), special_flags=pygame.BLEND_RGBA_MULT)

This will create a mask with a gradient alpha channel that goes from 0 (completely transparent) at the left edge to 255 (completely opaque) at the right edge, and apply it to your image. The result is an image that fades out at the edges.

Please note that this is a simple example and might not work perfectly for your specific use case. You might need to adjust the gradient or the blending mode to get the desired effect.
