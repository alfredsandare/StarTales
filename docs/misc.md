## Celestial body size
The unit of size used in-game is just the radius of a planet (in km) divided by 400.

## Planetary temperature
Temperature is represented with a made up scale, which mainly comes from the effective temperature formula but also from atmospheric greenhouse gases. The formula and constants for it can be found in file physics/terrestrial_body.py in function calculate_temperature().
